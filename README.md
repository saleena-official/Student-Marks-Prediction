# Student Marks Prediction 📊

A Python-based Machine Learning project to **predict student marks** using study hours, attendance, and sleep hours.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Linear Regression model** that predicts student performance.  
It is designed for beginners in **AI & Machine Learning** and showcases:

- Loading and analyzing datasets with **Pandas**
- Splitting data into **training and testing sets**
- Training a **Linear Regression model** using **Scikit-learn**
- Predicting marks and evaluating model performance
- Presenting results clearly and professionally

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository
You can either clone it using Git or download as ZIP:

Clone the project using Git:
```bash
git clone 
https://github.com/saleena-official/Student-Marks-Prediction.git
```

Or Downloaf it as a ZIP from GitHub

### Step 2: Install Python (if not installed)
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed:

```bash
python --version
```
### Step 3: Install required libraries
Install all libraries using 
requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
This will install:
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn

### Step 4: Run the Python script
Navigate to the project folder and run:
```bash
python main.py
```
### Step 5: Check the output
After running, you will see:

Actual Marks: [55 65 80 45]
Predicted Marks: [56.2 64.5 79.1 46.3]
Mean Absolute Error: 1.5

●Actual Marks → Real student marks from CSV
●Predicted Marks → Model’s predictions
●Mean Absolute Error (MAE) → Model accuracy

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

- Working with CSV datasets
- Using Pandas for data handling
- Implementing Linear Regression with Scikit-learn
- Splitting data for training and testing
- Evaluating model performance metrics
